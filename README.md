# Automatic Generation of Bounds for the Lorenz System Using Quantifier Elimination

xxx

## Getting Started

This project contains the REDUCE source files for the computation of bounds using quantifier elimination with application to the chaotic Lorenz system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the computer algebra system REDUCE:

http://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.net/

There are two main versions of REDUCE available, which are based on different Lips libraries:

| redcsl   | Codemist Standard Lisp (CSL) |
| redpsl   | Portable Standard Lisp (PSL) |
